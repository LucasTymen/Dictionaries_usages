Using Dictionaries
Get A Key

Once you have a dictionary, you can access the values in it by providing the key. For example, let’s imagine we have a
dictionary that maps buildings to their heights, in meters:
"""
building_heights = {"Burj Khalifa": 828, "Shanghai Tower": 632, "Abraj Al Bait": 601, "Ping An": 599, "Lotte World Tower": 554.5, "One World Trade": 541.3}
"""
Then we can access the data in it like this:
"""
building_heights["Burj Khalifa"]
# 828
building_heights["Ping An"]
# 599
"""
Instructions
