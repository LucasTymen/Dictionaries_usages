Using Dictionaries
Review

In this lesson, you’ve learned how to go through dictionaries and access keys and values in different ways. Specifically,
you have seen how to:

    Use a key to get a value from a dictionary
    Check for existence of keys
    Remove a key: value pair from a dictionary
    Iterate through keys and values in dictionaries

Instructions
1.

We have provided a pack of tarot cards, tarot. You are going to do a three card spread of your past, present, and future.

Create an empty dictionary called spread.
2.

The first card you draw is card 13. Pop the value assigned to the key 13 out of the tarot dictionary and assign it as
the value of the "past" key of spread.

To pop a value from one dictionary and assign it to another, you can use syntax like:

new_dict["new key"] = old_dict.pop("old key")

3.

The second card you draw is card 22. Pop the value assigned to the key 22 out of the tarot dictionary and assign it as
the value of the "present" key of spread.
4.

The third card you draw is card 10. Pop the value assigned to the key 10 out of the tarot dictionary and assign it as
the value of the "future" key of spread.
5.

Iterate through the items in the spread dictionary and for each key: value pair, print out a string that says:

Your {key} is the {value} card.

6.
